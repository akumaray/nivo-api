# nivo-api

Rendering API for [nivo](https://github.com/plouc/nivo) dataviz React/d3 components.

A [demo](https://nivo-api.herokuapp.com/) is available on heroku, but may not respond depending on usage.

## How it works

The API expose some of the [nivo](https://github.com/plouc/nivo) charts by using [React server side environment](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/environments.html).

First you will have to make a post request on the desired endpoint, for example:

```
POST /charts/line
=> 148e6145-6130-4c70-a21e-bfe91924c612
```

The response is the id of the chart config, then you can fetch it with a regular GET request

```
GET /r/148e6145-6130-4c70-a21e-bfe91924c612
```
